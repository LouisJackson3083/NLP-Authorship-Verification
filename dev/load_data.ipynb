While many of today's horror fans would find little to frighten , it's a wonderful example of creating atmosphere on a VERY limited budget . The movie concerns the ghost of a ferryman , seeking revenge for being unjustly hanged . He's out to get those who ' done him wrong ' . My biggest problem with the story is that it gets away from the spooky swamp too often in favor of a love story . Had the movie concentrated more on the Strangler and the creepy swamp and less on the love story , Strangler of the Swamp would have been much better . The direction of Frank Wisbar is tight and he gets the most out of the limited funding he was given . One final note , the movie stars Blake Edwards ( of Pink Panther fame ) in an early role .

What a wonderful discovery of a young juvenile singer named Bobby Breen from a time when most of America was enchanted by Shirley Temple ! He plays a New Orleans boy raised by former slave Louise \" Imitation of Life \" Beavers after his parents died in the Civil War . Besides her , Breen also has Matthew \" Stymie \" Beard as a friend . Then he finds out about his Yankee relatives and moves to New York . Only the butler can relate to him there .

Starting out on the first leg of a journey that takes the Prescott family West via the Erie Canal , the picture tells the story of how it might have been for thousands of pioneers , settlers and adventurers as they searched for a new life beyond what passed for civilization in the mid to late 1800's . Probably the main reason to tune in is for the veritable all-star cast , as Reynolds is joined at various times by Karl Malden , Gregory Peck , George Peppard and Robert Preston , with a host of others contributing to the story . Some are merely incidental , as in John Wayne's portrayal of General William Tecumseh Sherman , but taken as a whole , it's a treat to see so many fine actors in a single film .

Instead of some boring theological piece with lots of talking heads . we get a doc that uses taking heads sparingly , and adds film clips that tell the story along with some really great graphics . Sure there is some humor in the piece . When Jesus went missing for three days at the age of 12 , according to the Bible , Mary and Joseph went looking for him . I kept thinking that someone should have been calling Child Protective Services for their neglect in keeping track of a 12 year old . Then he went missing for 18 years . Was he on milk cartons during this time ? The graphics showing the period in which Jesus lived and the four decade gap before anything was even written about him was very interesting .

Your self-confidence wanes and you lose to the desire to make more goals. Careful! Chaos is right around the corner. Be an agent of change and get SMART with your goals. Here's the secret: Specific: Your goals should be clear and definite. Measurable: There should be a quantifiable standard against which to measure results. Achievable: Are your goals realistically doable with the time and resources available? Relevant: Is what really matters most to you reflected in your goals?

The cause, they say, is that power generators can continue to charge what most characterize as exorbitant prices for their electricity -- and consumers ultimately face the daunting task of paying them. No matter if all of the bills are signed, the leaders say California's power market will remain a seller's game that gouges overmatched consumers.
